The problem faced with the Mars Pathfinder is that the lower priority task is locking the resource and not allowing the higher priority task to execute due to which the reset option is enabled after a particular interval of time if the higher priority task is not using the resource. So when the system resets, all the taken images are being lost which was one of the failure of the Mars Pathfinder. This happened due to the concept of priority inversion. So we use priority inheritance to eradicate the priority inversion concept which led to the success to the fuctioning of Mars Pathfinder.
